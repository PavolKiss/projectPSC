McLaren 720S
710 hp
341 max
 3.9 s 0-100
McLaren’s know-how with lightweight, aerodynamic, ferocious supercars is undeniable, and the 720S is proof. A 710-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed automatic. A Drift mode is offered in addition to Comfort, Sport, and Track settings to allow for adrenaline; cruising is surprisingly quiet and civilized. A touchscreen infotainment system is standard, as is a digital gauge cluster that hides away in the dashboard when in Track mode.

Alfa Romeo 4C
237 hp
250KM/H
4,5s
This is a sexy, mid-engined Italian exotic carved down to affordable scale, and it's available as a coupe or with a targa top. Powered by a 237-hp turbo four and weighing less than 2500 pounds, its zippy power-to-weight ratio matches its zippy steering ratio; sadly, only a six-speed automatic is available. The 4C practically anticipates road challenges, but the seats are tight, there's almost no luggage room, and it's so low it's tough to get out of—none of which matters once behind the wheel.

Alfa Romeo Giulia
280hp
240
5.5 s
An emotional, hot-blooded Italian sedan, the Giulia sets pulses racing even before you get behind the wheel. A 280-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four with an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive is standard in this 10Best Cars winner. Leather seats, dual exhaust tips, and a flat-bottomed steering wheel are also standard, while all-wheel drive is optional. A 6.5-inch or optional 8.8-inch touchscreen provide connectivity; high-tech features like adaptive cruise control are available.

Aston Martin DB11
600 hp
321
3.6
Turning up its looks and performance literally to 11, the DB11 and the droptop DB11 Volante continue Aston Martin’s tradition of blending style and power. The coupe gets a choice of two twin-turbo engines—a 503-hp 4.0-liter V-8 or a 600-hp 5.2-liter V-12—with eight-speed automatics. In our testing, the V-12 launched the DB11 from zero to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds. A lightweight structure, torque-vectoring system, and stiff chassis result in agile handling. Want to feel like 007? This is your car.

Audi A8
460
240
4.0-5.5
The A8 is the pinnacle of Audi’s luxury sedans: packed with tech including autonomous driving features, and redolent with luxury options—even a back-seat foot warmer. A 340-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is standard; a 460-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is optional. All-wheel drive, an eight-speed automatic, and air suspension are standard. An optional suspension system scans the road for imperfections, adjusting to soak them up. A 449-hp plug-in hybrid with inductive charging is in the works.

Lamborghini Aventador
740hp
350
2.7
Brutally powerful and obscenely flamboyant, the Aventador is unburdened by reality. Crazy expensive and crazy fast, it’s capable of amazing performance without feeling like it’s going to spin out into a ditch, which is refreshing in a supercar. Available as a coupe (for now), it has a 6.5-liter 730-hp V-12, a 7-speed automated manual transmission and all-wheel drive. For the ultimate, the Superveloce has 740 hp and a claimed top speed of 217 mph. In our testing, it did 0-60 mph in 2.7 seconds.

Bentley Mulsanne
505hp
300
4.9
The Mulsanne is a leather-lined, wood-adorned rolling lounge for the well-heeled motorist. A 505-hp 6.75-liter twin-turbo V-8 drives the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic. Although perfect for chauffeur duty, the Mulsanne is also a driver’s car with sharp steering, a poised chassis, and the moves of a smaller car. Rear-seat passengers will be similarly charmed, especially when the Mulsanne is personalized through the Mulliner customization program and its wide range of bespoke features.

Bmw X6
300
204
5.7
Unrestrained styling, raucous power, and surprising agility define the X6—although its fastback design limits rear-seat room and cargo space. A 300-hp 3.0-liter turbo inline-six with an eight-speed automatic can be ordered with either rear- or all-wheel drive. An audacious 445-hp 4.4-liter turbo V-8 is optional and comes only with all-wheel drive. The standard Driving Dynamics Control system allows for five distinct driving modes and an available air suspension provides even more fine-tuning.

Bugatti Chiron
1500
420
2.3
Leaving the 99.99 percent in its dust, the Chiron is a 1500-hp smackdown of every hypercar ever produced. An 8.0-liter 16-cylinder engine uses four turbochargers to make 1500 hp and 1180 lb-ft of torque, but calling its acceleration “heroic” would be an understatement—Bugatti claims a top speed of 261 mph. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic routes power to all four wheels, but it can do more than straight-line speed. The $2,998,000 price tag is a bourgeoisie bargain—hey, it’s under $3 million.

Dodge Viper
645
285
3.3
Viper is dying, because for all of its outrageousness and capability, sometimes you’re not looking for a singular experience. Sometimes, you just want to get where you’re going. But if you want to reflect on where you are with the person who set you up to get there, and make good on a promise you didn’t realize you could have meant 17 years ago, it turns out that’s one more thing the Viper excels at. Thank you, Mrs. Kowalski.

Fiat Doblo
120 
161
15.4
 The Italian automaker tried this time to create a more appealing family vehicle and not just a spacious practical utility vehicle. Both the front an rear fascias were revamped and the interior was completely redesigned. Using the Fiat/GM SCSS platform used by Fiat Qubo, Alfa Romeo MiTo and Opel Corsa, the new Doblo boasts the largest wheelbase in its class at 2755 mm (108.46 in). The car uses a new set of bi-link rear suspension system available with various component calibrations depending on vehicle application and standard ESP and hill-holder systems.

Ford Focus ST
252
257
6.3
The Focus ST belongs on any enthusiast’s short list, combining a high fun-to-drive factor with the every-day versatility of a four-door hatchback. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that cranks out 252 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque is standard, as is a six-speed manual gearbox. The ST shines on a winding road or track and actually offers decent fuel efficiency and value—as long as you avoid the pricey options. Torque steer, however, remains an issue, and the optional MyFord Touch is confusing.

Ford Transit
310
156
7.6
Ford’s full-size van is modern both under the hood and behind the wheel, with useful tech to aid today’s hard-working folk. Available in three body lengths, two wheelbases, and three roof heights, it’s a cargo hauler or a people mover with up to 15 seats. Ford Telematics help track your fleet with GPS-based monitoring. Engine choices include a 275-hp V-6, a 310-hp twin-turbo V-6, or a 185-hp turbo-diesel inline-five with 350 lb-ft of torque; each have a six-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive.

Genesis G90
420
238
5.3
With elegant styling and a first-class cabin, the G90 is the Genesis brand’s first attempt at a luxury sedan. Few options are offered; instead, nearly every conceivable feature is standard. Highlights include a 12.3-inch touchscreen for infotainment, adaptive dampers, a head-up display, automated emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. Two engines are offered—a 365-hp 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 and a 420-hp 5.0-liter V-8—both with an eight-speed automatic and rear- or all-wheel drive.

GTS
503
310
3.0
The gullwings are gone, but the GT is still set to swoop in and snag buyers away from its archnemesis, the Porsche 911. The GT—along with its roadster counterpart—has a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 connected to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. This combination delivers 469 horsepower and gives the GT a top speed of 189 mph (188 for the roadster). The GT S brings 515 hp. All models have active aerodynamic louvers that adjust drag and engine cooling on the fly.

Honda Civic
180
210
7.0
The Civic exemplifies automotive excellence and mixes fun with efficiency and practicality. Precise steering, a solid chassis, and a well-tuned suspension provide both a compliant ride and sweet handling. Sedans and coupes get a 158-hp 2.0-liter four or a 174-hp turbo 1.5-liter four paired with a six-speed manual or a CVT. The turbo is standard on the hatchback; a 180-hp Sport trim is optional and a 10Best winner for 2018. The cabin is spacious, but some may find the seats lack proper support.

Honda Odyssey
280
180
6.6
Quiet, comfortable, flexible, and packed with tons of modern technology, the Honda Odyssey has a formidable family-friendly legacy. A 280-hp 3.5-liter V-6 drives the front wheels through a nine-speed automatic; Touring and Elite trims get a 10-speed, an onboard vacuum cleaner, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and a digital rear-seat monitor. Automated emergency braking and lane-keeping assist are standard starting on the midrange EX trim, and second-row seats are reconfigurable in all but the base LX.

Hyundai Elantra Sport
201
201
6.3
If you’re thirsty for inexpensive speed, the Elantra Sport might wet your whistle. A gutsy turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-four pushes 201 hp to the front wheels via a six-speed manual transmission or optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. “Sporty” design cues along with upgraded suspension and brakes further separate the Sport from its lesser sibling. A Premium package includes an 8-inch touchscreen, nav, eight-speaker sound system, and a sunroof, but its cost erodes the value proposition.

Chevrolet Bolt EV
200
149
6.5
Quick on its feet and fun to drive, the Bolt EV gives Tesla a run for its money. A floor-mounted battery powers a 200-hp electric motor; in our testing, we recorded 96 MPGe and a 75-mph highway range of 190 miles. It rides well over rough roads and acceleration is great, launching the car to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds. The cabin has a 10.2-inch touchscreen and a driver-facing 8.0-inch digital gauge cluster. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and 4G LTE Wi-Fi are available.

Chevrolet Camaro
455
265
4.1
Gutsy engines, aggressive sheetmetal, and rear-wheel drive are essential for any muscle car, but the Camaro adds excellent handling and great steering, too. Available as a coupe or convertible, the base engine is a turbo four-cylinder; a 335-hp V-6 and a 455-hp V-8 are optional. All offer either a six-speed manual or optional eight-speed automatic. The interior, though, is tight and offers limited visibility. The V-6 and V-8 Camaros are 10Best winners for 2018, making them back-to-back champs.

Chevrolet Corvette
460
275
3.9
Forget the bow tie—the Corvette’s performance puts it on a level with some of the best sports cars around. Some of that cred is thanks to the growling 455-hp 6.2-liter V-8 under the hood, which comes with the standard seven-speed manual or an optional eight-speed automatic. The Corvette isn’t just about brute force. It’s also an excellent handler, especially in its Grand Sport trim, which adds bodywork and chassis bits from the racy Z06 Corvette and is a repeat winner of our 10Best Cars award.

Kia Rio
130
194
8.5
Cheap and cheerful is the Rio’s ambition and it does so with a style all its own. In both the sedan and the hatchback, a 130-hp 1.6-liter inline-four engine drives the front wheels through either a six-speed manual or automatic. The base LX trim is the definition of basic transportation, making do without power windows, Bluetooth connectivity, or cruise control. Goodies such as Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and automated emergency braking require stepping all the way up to the top-spec EX trim.

Lexus GS
241
230
6.6
The GS hopes you’ll look past its polarizing looks and consider it a sports sedan worthy of competing with the best from here and Germany. The GS200t’s 241-hp 2.0-liter turbo four, rear-wheel drive, and an eight-speed automatic are standard. GS350 models get a 311-hp 3.5-liter V-6 and eight-speed auto; optional all-wheel drive has a six-speed automatic. GS450h hybrids make 338 hp with a CVT. Enthusiasts will want the F Sport package with a tuned suspension, larger wheels, and upgraded brakes.

Mercedes Bens Metris
208
180
8.4
Slotted between its full-size sibling, the Sprinter, and smaller vans like the Ford Transit Connect, the Metris offers relatively nimble dimensions with the cargo-carrying ability of larger vans. Under the hood is a 2.0-liter turbo four that makes 208 hp with a seven-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive; the interior can be configured to carry cargo or passengers (seven standard or eight optionally). There’s plenty of tech, too, including Crosswind Assist and load-adaptive stability control.

Mercedes Benz S Class
362
207
5.3
The S-class has always been synonymous with luxury, and it continues that proud tradition. Sedan models are powered by either a 362-hp twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 or a 463-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. Rear-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic are standard; all-wheel drive is optional. Coupe and convertible models get the V-8. In keeping with the car’s flagship status, the S-class can be loaded to the gills with technology, including active body control and enhanced autonomous driving functions.

Mercedes Benz Sprinter
280
120
8.2
With an array of body styles to haul either cargo or people, including seating for up to 12, the Sprinter is a true jack-of-all-trades. Two powertrain options are available—a 161-hp 2.1-liter turbo-diesel with a seven-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive or a 188-hp 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6 with a five-speed automatic and rear- or four-wheel drive. The Sprinter also features loads of high-tech safety gear including crosswind stabilization, lane-departure warning, and collision prevention.

Ford Mustang
460
249
4.3
The galloping pony nestled in the grille serves as a reminder that the Mustang is most at home on the open road. Both the coupe and convertible come with your choice of a 310-hp turbo four or a 460-hp V-8; choose from a six-speed manual or a 10-speed automatic transmission. A manual-transmission-only, 475-hp Steve McQueen–inspired Bullitt special edition will join the lineup later in 2018. The rear-wheel-drive chassis is eager to attack corners while enabling a smooth ride when cruising.

Nissan GT-R
600
307
2.9
Doesn’t matter what you call it—GT-R or, more fittingly, Godzilla—Nissan’s range topper is a supercar-stomping, high-tech dynamo. Its 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6 makes a mighty 565 hp while a six-speed dual-clutch automatic and all-wheel drive team up to put all that power to the pavement. The GT-R’s quick steering, rigid structure and adjustable suspension can make even amateurs feel positively heroic from behind the wheel. Want more? Check out the track-ready NISMO-tuned variant with 600 hp.

Porsche Cayman
300
275
3.9
There are few driving experiences as rewarding as a jaunt in a 718 Cayman, a repeat winner of our 10Best Cars award. The Cayman’s pair of turbo fours (base gets a 300-hp 2.0-liter; the S has a 350-hp 2.5-liter) may sound unrefined, but they’re torquey and quick. An engaging six-speed manual is standard; a seven-speed automatic is optional. A GTS model is new for 2018. It uses a 365-hp version of the 2.5-liter engine and comes with a brake-based torque vectoring and adaptive dampers.

Rolls-Royce Wraith
624
250
4.3
The Wraith is derived from the Ghost, but it has its own distinct—some might say sporting—personality. With a 624-hp version of the Ghost’s V-12, the wheelbase is shorter and the fastback body is unique. The Wraith is quicker and more nimble than the Ghost, with a light touch to the steering and a gently controlled ride. Rolls tradition abounds, with rear-hinged power doors, the available Starlight headliner, and an array of options that can launch the already-lofty base price into high orbit.

Tesla Model S
532
249
2.8
Boasting up to 337 miles of range, the Model S is the all-electric dream car envied by many. Icing on the cake is Ludicrous mode, which blasts the top P100D to 60 mph in a claimed 2.5 seconds. The lower-spec models offer reduced driving ranges and features. Luxury items such as an air filter that Tesla says can protect occupants from bioweapons and pollutants—plus available high-tech features such as Tesla’s Autopilot—seal the deal.

Toyota Sienna
296
181
7.0
It’s the Camry of minivans: The Sienna appeals to a wide range of families looking for roomy, comfortable, and high-quality transport—and it succeeds. A 296-hp 3.5-liter V-6 paired to an eight-speed automatic drives the front or—in a segment exclusive—all four wheels, a bonus when the weather turns nasty. An intercom allows front-seat occupants to address the third row, and a Blu-Ray entertainment display keeps the kids in line. Unfortunately, amusement isn’t on the menu for enthusiasts.

Toyota Yaris IA
106
193
8.7
Don’t let the badge fool you: Toyota’s Yaris iA is actually a Mazda 2 in disguise and handles the corners with the aplomb you would expect from the makers of the MX-5 Miata. The 1.5-liter four-cylinder makes 106 horsepower and is paired to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. The monospec Yaris iA offers a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, low-speed automated emergency braking, keyless entry, and Bluetooth connectivity as standard; navigation isn’t an option, however.

Volkswagen Golf
170
204
7.3
With another 10Best Cars win for 2018, the Golf is a fixture on our awards circuit. We’re not dispensing the honor out of habit—the Golf is truly excellent. It comes standard with a 170-hp turbo inline-four and a six-speed manual; a six-speed automatic is available. The Golf is responsive, predictable, and genuinely fun to drive. The hatchback makes the Golf practical, its price tag makes it attainable, and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto serve as sweeteners for the younger crowd.
